            <p><strong>Captain 2023-2025</strong></p>
            <p>Being a college athlete on Lindenwood’s third-ranked Division One rugby team was one of the most impactful experiences of my life. I joined the program in the fall of 2021 and instantly fell in love with the culture, the energy, and the deep sense of connection within the team. With over 94 players, including teammates from more than 18 different countries, I had the opportunity to build friendships and learn from a diverse range of perspectives. Throughout my time on the team, we won multiple national titles in both 15s and sevens, pushing each other to the highest level of competition.</p>
            <p>In my junior year, I was honored to be named captain, a role that taught me invaluable leadership skills. Leading such a large and diverse group required me to develop strong communication, adaptability, and the ability to unite people toward a common goal over an extended season that lasted more than a year. Balancing the demands of being a student-athlete was no easy task, especially while completing a double major. I had to master time management, prioritization, and discipline to excel both on the field and in the classroom. This experience shaped me into a stronger leader and reinforced my ability to perform under pressure while fostering teamwork and excellence.</p>
