                <p>This study analyzed the impact of gibberellin (a plant growth hormone) on two dwarf mutant millet variants to determine the nature of their genetic mutations. The objective was to assess whether these mutations inhibited gibberellin production or deactivated its effects through hydroxyl group binding. By examining plant growth data and response patterns, we gained insights into the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting gibberellin metabolism and its role in plant development.</p>
