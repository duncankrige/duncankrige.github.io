                <p><strong>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, 2021 - 2025</strong></p>
                <p>Studying Data Science and Mathematics at Lindenwood University was a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. Completing my double major gave me a strong foundation in data analysis, problem-solving, and technology. I took courses in machine learning, linear regression, data structures, and computer science, all of which deepened my understanding of how data shapes the world around us.</p>

                <p>I attended Kingswood College, one of the top high schools in the country, renowned for its world-class education under the IEB system. Ranked 35 in the world. Moving away from home to join this prestigious boarding school was a transformative experience that equipped me with invaluable life skills and leadership qualities. In 2019, I was honored to serve as Head of Boarding, leading over 60 boys and managing the daily operations of the dormitory. Additionally, I was elected as a school prefect by the student body, reflecting the trust and responsibility placed in me. Beyond leadership, I earned Colours for sports and actively contributed to several committees, further enriching my high school journey</p>

                <p><strong>Collegiate Rugby Player of the week (CRAA-D1A)</strong></p>
                <p>Being a college athlete on Lindenwood’s third-ranked Division One rugby team was one of the most impactful experiences of my life. I joined the program in the fall of 2021 and instantly fell in love with the culture, the energy, and the deep sense of connection within the team. With over 94 players, including teammates from more than 18 different countries, I had the opportunity to build friendships and learn from a diverse range of perspectives. Throughout my time on the team, we won multiple national titles in both 15s and sevens, pushing each other to the highest level of competition.</p>
                <p>In my junior year, I was honored to be named captain, a role that taught me invaluable leadership skills. Leading such a large and diverse group required me to develop strong communication, adaptability, and the ability to unite people toward a common goal over an extended season that lasted more than a year. Balancing the demands of being a student-athlete was no easy task, especially while completing a double major. I had to master time management, prioritization, and discipline to excel both on the field and in the classroom. This experience shaped me into a stronger leader and reinforced my ability to perform under pressure while fostering teamwork and excellence.</p>
